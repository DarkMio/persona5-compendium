This is a leveling guide for all confidants. Note that you gain extra points for each confidant if you're having a
matching persona in your personal roster.

## Twin Wardens Confidant

The twin wardens require you to fuse personas for a given task. While some of them are more obvious it might be hard
to find an optimal solution. If you're searching for fusing examples and full fusing tables, it's recommended to look
at the excellent fusing tables of
[Chinhodado on his github page](https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/#/list).  
Simply start by typing the persona you need and click on its name. There are many combinations to fuse a certain
persona - most of the time you will have better combinations already in your roster.

### Rank 1: Jack Frost with Mabufu

Fuse Asparas (Priestess) with Berith (Hierophant) in order to get a Jack Frost with Mabufu. If you already have a
Jack Frost fused, you can use him in battles, since he learns Mabufu early in.

### Rank 2: Shiisa with Frei

You can, after acquiring Jack Frost, reuse him for this fusion. Makami has per default Frei, fusing him with Jack Frost
resolves in a Shiisa with Frei.

### Rank 3: Matador with Magaru

Mokoi (Death) fused with the treasure persona Regent (Emperor) yields you instantly a Matador with Magaru.  
However, Regent is a rare treasure persona, thus it might be problematic to have it in the first place.

Another combination is Obariyon (Fool) fused with Nekomata (Magician) which has Magaru naturally.

### Rank 4: Flauros with Tarukaja

Flauros is a triple fusion and one of the three already has Tarukaja. The fusion consist of Andras (Devil),
Eligor (Emperor) and Berith (Hierophant), all of which can be found as regular enemies in palaces.
