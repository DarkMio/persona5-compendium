### Talks

Each encounter group can have different types, in which the answers to successfully capture a persona differ.
Upon triggering a "Hold up!" you will be able to see that groups character type and decide which answer fits best.  
You **cannot** capture a persona that has a higher level than you - even if it talks to you and begs for mercy. You will
instead always receive an item.

Persona character types - answers:

- **Upbeat**    - jokes, no serious / vague
- **Timid**     - kind, no jokes / vague
- **Irritable** - serious, no kind / vague
- **Gloomy**    - vague, no serious / jokes

| Me not understand in what way you superior to me...                                           |        |       |                             |        |
| [...] How me know you really winning?                                                         |        |       |                             |        |
